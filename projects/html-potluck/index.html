        <h2>Ingredients </h2>
        <h3>For the Dog Treats</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                2½ cups whole wheat flour
            </li>
            <li>
                1 large egg
            </li>
            <li>
                1 cup peanut butter
            </li>
            <li>
                1 cup water
            </li>
            <li>
                2 tablespoons honey 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Frosting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                2 tablespoons peanut butter
            </li>
            <li>
                1 tablespoon honey
            </li>
            <li>
                ⅓ cup cornstarch
            </li>
            <li>
                3-4 tablespoons hot water
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with 
                parchment paper. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, combine flour and the egg. Add the peanut 
                butter, water, and honey, and stir until you have a stiff 
                dough. The dough becomes very firm and sticky. You may 
                need to use your hands, or the paddle attachment on your mixer.
                <ul>
                    <i>2½ cups whole wheat flour,</i>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <i>1 large egg,</i>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <i>1 cup peanut butter,</i>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <i>1 cup water,</i>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <i>2 tablespoons honey</i>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough about 
                ½-inch thick and use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes. 
                The treats barely spread and rise, so get creative with 
                your shapes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 18-20 minutes, until golden. Once done, 
                set aside to cool. (If you have smaller cookies, 
                use less time, otherwise the bottom might burn.)
            </li>
            <li>
                To make the frosting, combine the peanut butter and honey 
                in a microwavable bowl, and heat in the microwave in 
                15 second increments, stirring in between, until melted.
                <ul>
                    <i>2 tablespoons peanut butter,</i>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <i>1 tablespoon honey</i>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the melted peanut butter mixture to the cornstarch and 
                stir until just combined.
                <ul>
                    <i>⅓ cup cornstarch</i>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Slowly add in the water 1 tablespoon at a time until you 
                have reached the consistency that you would like. For a 
                thinner frosting, add more water.
                <ul>
                    <i>3-4 tablespoons hot water</i>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the frosting to a piping bag and pipe designs on top 
                of each dog treat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Frost the treats with the peanut butter/honey mixture for 
                an even more tempting cookie.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How to Store</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Once fully cooled, I store homemade peanut butter dog 
                biscuits in an airtight container (very important) 
                in the refrigerator, for up to 1 month. This recipe makes 
                24 medium dog cookies, so you’ll have plenty to share 
                whenever your dog needs a healthy treat.

        <h2>Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 large egg
            </li>
            <li>
                1 cup unsweetened applesauce
            </li>
            <li>
                2 cups gluten-free oat flour
            </li>
            <li>
                ¾ cup gluten-free old-fashioned rolled oats
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment 
                paper and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a hand whisk, beat the egg and set it aside.
                <ul>
                    <i>1 large egg,</i>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine the applesauce, oat flour, and rolled oats in a 
                large bowl. Pour all but 1 tablespoon of the egg over 
                the mixture and set aside the remaining 1 tablespoon of egg.
                <ul>
                    <i>1 cup unsweetened applesauce,</i>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <i>2 cups gluten-free oat flour,</i>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <i>¾ cup gluten-free old-fashioned rolled oats</i>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a wooden spoon, stir the mixture until a dough forms. 
                The dough should be tacky but not overly sticky. Add a bit 
                more or less flour if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take a 2-tablespoon-sized piece of dough (approximate) and 
                roll it into a tube. It should be about 10 inches long and 
                about the width of a pencil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take each tube and make into a U shape, then twist the ends 
                together and fold back to the top. This makes the pretzel 
                shape. Pinch the ends in to make sure they’re secure.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the pretzels onto the baking tray. Brush the top of 
                each pretzel with the remaining egg.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for approximately 25-30 minutes, until they're slightly 
                browned and become crispy. The pretzels should be pretty 
                hard, just like pups love them!
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the oven and allow to cool before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How to Store</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                These oat and apple dog pretzels will keep well for up to 2 
                weeks. Let them cool completely and keep them stored at 
                room temperature in an airtight container to keep them fresh. 
                Preferably place them in a high cupboard where inquisitive 
                noses can’t reach!
