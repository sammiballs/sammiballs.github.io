                <h3>Cast</h3>
                <p>
                    Bullock and Kidman play sisters Sally and Gillian Owens, 
                    descended from a long line of witches. Raised by 
                    their aunts after their parents' death from a family 
                    curse, the sisters were taught the uses of practical 
                    magic as they grew up. As adults, Sally and Gillian 
                    must use their magic to destroy the evil spirit of 
                    Gillian's abusive boyfriend before it kills them.

                <p>
                    The film was released on October 16, 1998. The film 
                    grossed $68.3 million worldwide against a $75 million 
                    budget. Upon initial release, the film received mixed 
                    reviews from critics who found the film's combination 
                    of different genres, including supernatural fantasy, 
                    domestic abuse drama, romantic comedy, and crime 
                    procedural, to be jarring. It has since gained a cult 
                    following for its cast, soundtrack, and feminist themes. 
                    A sequel, tentatively titled Practical Magic 2, is 
                    scheduled for a September 18, 2026, release.
