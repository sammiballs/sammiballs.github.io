        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <h3>CRUST</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Line an 8x8-inch square pan with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, 
                and granulated white sugar. Mix until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan, creating 
                an even crust. Set aside.
            </li>
            <h3>CHEESECAKE FILLING</h3>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C).
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and white sugar together 
                until smooth and creamy using an electric mixer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the heavy cream, sour cream, vanilla extract, and a 
                pinch of salt. Mix until smooth and fully incorporated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the cheesecake filling into the prepared crust and 
                smooth the top with a spatula.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 35 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center 
                is slightly jiggly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let the cheesecake cool on the counter for 1 hour, then 
                transfer it to the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours, 
                or overnight.
            </li>
            <h3>PISTACHIO KUNAFA</h3>
            <li>
                Heat vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once hot, fry the kataifi until golden and crispy, stirring 
                occasionally. Remove from the pan and set aside to drain 
                on paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the kataifi has cooled, mix it with pistachio cream until 
                fully combined. Set aside
            </li>
            <h3>CHOCOLATE GANACHE</h3>
            <li>
                In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the heavy cream in the microwave 
                until it just begins to simmer (about 30-45 seconds).
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let it sit for 
                10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                After 10 minutes, stir the mixture until smooth and fully 
                melted.
            </li>
            <h3>ASSEMBLY</h3>
            <li>
                Once the cheesecake has chilled, top it with the pistachio 
                kunafa mixture, spreading it evenly across the top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drizzle the chocolate ganache over the pistachio kunafa 
                and cheesecake layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Refrigerate the cheesecake for an additional 30 minutes to 
                allow the ganache to set before slicing and serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
